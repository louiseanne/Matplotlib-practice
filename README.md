## Drake Lyric Analysis Bar Chart
In this bar chart, I used a data set from [Juico Bowley on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/juicobowley/drake-lyrics?select=drake_data.json) that has Drake's entire discography. After consulting someone who is actually a Drake fan, I then counted how many times certain words appeared in songs in his discography (specifically, "baby", "drake", "girl", "man", "money", "shawty", "what", and "yeah"). For "shawty" and "yeah", I accounted for different spellings: "shawty" included both "shawty" and "shorty", and "yeah" included "yeah", "ya", "yea". The bar chart shows how often each of these words appear in Drake's entire discography.

## Taylor Swift Song Analysis Line Plot
In this line plot, I used a data set from [Irenetrampoline on Github](https://github.com/irenetrampoline/taylor-swift-lyrics/blob/master/az_lyrics.json) that has Taylor Swift's discography up until roughly 2014. This was a more limited data set than the Drake dataset, so I ended up looking simply at the amount of songs released each year from 2006-2014. People always say that Taylor Swift only writes about love, so I compared the total songs written to the amount of songs which mentioned the word "love". This line plot compares the amount of songs Taylor released from 2006-2014 overall, to how many of those songs included the word "love".
