## Drake Lyric Analysis Bar Chart
In this bar chart, I used a data set from [Juico Bowley on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/juicobowley/drake-lyrics?select=drake_data.json) that has Drake's entire discography. After consulting someone who is actually a Drake fan, I then counted how many times certain words appeared in songs in his discography (specifically, "baby", "drake", "girl", "man", "money", "shawty", "what", and "yeah"). For "shawty" and "yeah", I accounted for different spellings: "shawty" included both "shawty" and "shorty", and "yeah" included "yeah", "ya", "yea". The bar chart shows how often each of these words appear in Drake's entire discography.
