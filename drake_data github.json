was, I never shy away\nThis life is really something you get lost in\nI know niggas that got famous and they bought friends\nI had friends that only had half of they heart in\nIt's hard to accept now, and it was hard then\nBut I treated you like gold, I was all in\nSpoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in\nBurnin' incense in your new apartment\nBut you got no sense when it come to\nLost you to the game, I gotta hold that\nHow you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?\nI'll be better off without you, and we know that\nYou ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back\nLike I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap\nYou sold me up the river, but I rowed back\nYou put me on the road without a roadmap\nI'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts\n\n[Interlude: Drake &

now we out here matchin'\nI did it by being myself with no dramatic acting\nI couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen\nLost you to the game, I gotta face that\nReally think I lost you like a ways back\nAlways sayin' how a nigga never play fair\nI took you up under my wing and you just stayed there\nYou was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair\nWe started this from the bottom, now you alone there\nShit, you treat it like it's home there\nDependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share\nI still love you to my last days\nI never knew that shit would be this fast-paced\nI never thought I'd see awards in a glass case\nI could've ended up in your crib with a masked face\nIt could've went left on a couple bad days\nWhen I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place\nSee me these days, I never got on a sad face\nSee me these days, I\nLost you to the game, and I see why\nIt was always you and I without the T-Y\nThis is not one of them stories that got three sides\nThis is not one of them stories you could rewind\nLike I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap\nYou drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back\nYou wrote me off and then you never

mornin' on all my quiet nights\nBut you can rest assured that my mind is right\nGet no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days\nNever stick around to see shit change\nGet lil' updates,

star\nSwear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity\nI am a reflection of all of your insecurities\nBehind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping\nDone talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me\nThere's real ones around me\nI want to make sure they learn from me\nI want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety\nHe can't even dip out to see me in an emergency\nMy

of dem ones\u2014right\n\n[Verse]\nWeston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny\nBack when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies\nFeel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries\nThen bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it\nHe was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement\nHe let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment\nThen he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission\nWe probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him\nFeel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know\nFeel like the difference between us really startin' to show\nI'm lookin at they first week numbers like, \"What are those?\"\nI mean, you boys not even coming close\nI gave niggas like you a reason for celebration\nYou number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places\nLook in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear\nCreepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care\nNo tender love and care, no love and affection\nI got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting\nI might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson\nFeel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together\nYeah, but here we are and it's a new semester\n40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure\nA couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'\nA lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation\nYour best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day\nYou treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday\nYou don't be scorin' perfect\nYou don't be workin' like how we be workin'\nYou platinum like wrappers\nOn Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless\nYou get the message over and over like it was urgent\nAnd then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person\nThe only thing I did to end up here was put the work in\nAnd did it with a purpose\nUsed to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships\nNowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension\nA lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned\nShout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention\nIt's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder\nThe most successful rapper 35 and under\nI'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under\nThat's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded\nYeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin\nShe violated, I sent her back where it all started\nHow quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment\nLeave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness\nTold my momma that I found a lady in the east\nCancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite\nDon Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free\nI get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me\nYou wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique\nLast time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats\nI used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat\nNow the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE\nThe best ever, don't ever question, you know better\nBut shit ain\u2019t always how it seems when it\u2019s sewn together\nYeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it\nWeston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled\nDon't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal\nDon't let your newfound fame fool you\nOr cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this\nBeen flowin' stupid since Vince Carter\nWas on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit\nDrinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it\nY'all was so afraid to lay claim to it\nToo busy face screwin' on waste movements\nYou was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'\nFirst take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it\nAnd they still take to it\nBig Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid\nAnd we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it\nBut money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful\nBut I'm happiest when I can buy what I want\nGet high when I want\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, that's

unrealistic with none of my women\nI tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it\nRelationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision\nGuess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment\nCertain people need to tell me they're proud of me\nThat mean a lot to me\nNot havin' closure, it take a lot out of me\nThis year for Christmas I just want apologies\nSydney gave up on me when I went missin'\nSyn had a baby and treated me different\nErika sued me and opened a business\nWonder if they wish it could've been different\nWonder what they'd do put in my position\nI wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?\nWonder if they're second guessin' their decisions\nI hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving\nTryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough\nUntil enough is enough, and then it's too much\nYou tip the scale when I weigh my options\nWest Palm girls are spoiled rotten\nTiffany on you, you know you poppin'\nI'll kill somebody if they give you problems\nMaster bedroom's where we get it poppin'\nJust ignore all the skeletons in my closet\nI'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit\nSell my secrets and get top dollar\nSell my secrets for a Range Rover\nOpportunity and temptation\nThey would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation\nSell my secrets back to me if I was payin'\nWho's gonna save me when I need savin'?\nSince Take Care, I've

on, still nothin' set in stone\nWomen borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne\nAnd tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't\nFeelin' so distant from everyone I've known\nTo make everybody happy I think I would need a clone\nPlaces we get flown, parties that we've thrown\nI've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown\nIt's only been three years\nLook at how I've grown\nI'm just in my zone\nI call this shit the calm\nYeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm\nDedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond\nEverything will be okay and it won't even take that long\nYou can see it in my face or even read it on my palm\nLeader of the new school, it's proven and it's known\nI'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne\nI know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause\n\n[Break]\nYou know everything gon' be all right, I promise\nI apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but\n40 Mama always say don\u2019t

by my fame\nBecause every picture taken is a fan that you can gain\nThey love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain\nIt's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain\nWomen need attention, therefore, women will complain\nDevelop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame\nTryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game\nI just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne\nIt's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing\nSo I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain\nHoping Western Union doing currency exchange\n'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed\nLike, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range\nAnd he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change\nDamn, and I can only feel his pain\n'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain\nSo I'm filling out the form at the counter once again\nHe say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain\nI'm why your girl heart is in a sling\nCall me \"Heartbreak Drake\", I'm the hardest one to tame\nAs a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king\nWith my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain\nYeah, and see, this is the thang\nWhat they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain\nThe shit I write while staring out the window of a plane\nIs the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nUh\nI said I call this shit the calm\nBut I\u2019m the furthest thing from calm\nSwear I\u2019m putting on\nBut they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like\nMan",

game\nAnd realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same\nYeah, and plus things are just surreal at home\nPeople think I've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown\nAnd now security follow me everywhere\nSo I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone\nI think I'm scared of what the future holds\nI was wishing for some things and now am used to those\nEvery girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes\nThe honesty of my music has left me too exposed\nAll my old friends think I got a new crowd\nAnd people seem to notice every time I do smile\nI guess that mean they come few and far between\nEven though I'm living out what you would call the dream\nAnd my uncle ain't even messaging me\nAnd him missing in my life is kind of messing with me\nI hope this isn't one

role\nTalking bullshit as if it was for you to know\nAnd I don't have the heart\nTo give these bitch niggas the cue to go\nSo they stick around kicking out feedback\nAnd I entertain it as if I need that\nI had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that\nMy privacy about the only thing I need back, but\nIt's hard to think of them polite flows\nWhen Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes\nAnd Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes\nAnd you still make it even when they say your flight closed\nEyes hurting from the camera phone light shows\nLife was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd\nAlways said I'd say it all on the right track\nBut in this game you only lose when you fight back\nBlack diamond bracelets, showing you the basics\nI can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this\nAnd make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss\n24 hours from greatness, I'm that close\nDon't ever forget the moment you began to doubt\nTransitioning from fitting in to standing out\nLos Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South\nWatchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out\nAnd my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out\nSo I park about five houses down\nShe say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown\nBut I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around\nSo she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus\nBut yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness\nGot niggas reactin' without a sinus\n'Cause what I'm working with is timeless\nAnd promoters try to get me out to they club\nAnd say I have fun but I can't imagine how\n'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl\nStanding with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now\nAnd shit could get weird unless they all down\nAnd so I stay clear, we from a small town\nAnd everybody talks and everybody listen\nAnd somehow the truth just always comes up missing\nI've always been something that these labels can't buy\nEspecially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul\nAnd Sylvia be tellin' Tez, \"Damn, Drake fly\"\nAnd he just be like, \"Silly motherfucker, I know\nThat was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?\nHe just take them records and he gas up on 'em\nWayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em\nSurprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em\"\nOh, they did, Po, at least they tried to\nAnd that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you\nBut slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video\nAnd they think they can market you however they decide to\nNah, but 40 told me to do me\nAnd don't listen to anybody that knew me\n'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me\nAnd if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me\nBoy, and to my city I'm the 2-3\nDrug dealers live vicariously through me\nI quit school and it's not because I'm lazy\nI'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy\nUnderstand, I could get money with my eyes closed\nLost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo\nSo if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll\nSell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know\n'Cause they need it much more than I ever will\nI got new shit, I'm gettin' better still\nLittle niggas put my name in they verses\n'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal\nFuture said, \"'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill\"\nAnd I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel\nProblem with these other niggas, they ain't never real\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, that's all I can say", "track_views": "351.4K"}, {"album": "So Far Gone", "lyrics_title": "Little Bit (Ft.

bring you down to the level they at\nWell when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky\nThat's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap\nBut, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart,

purse off\nWill lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off\nAt least I got status because I could've been a local emcee\nAnd you probably would've been worse off\nSo I'ma take this hat

Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya\nCollege educated, got degrees in papers\nBut I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping\nOr rapping 'bout trapping you's a freak of nature\nSuch an anomaly, speak so well\nAnd talk so collegy, such an astonishing\nContrast to all the bullshit you've been following\nOn behalf of them, I offer my apologies\nMaybe with me you'll unlearn\nPutting all niggas

would need to\nDo more than just look you up and down\nTo see if I could read you\nAnd try to get inside your head only\nNot just stick my fingers in your middle\nTo get you to spread for me\nSo what I learned on my path to discover?\nYour story took one ugly turn after another\nI saw we wasn't on the same page\nI would've gave you strong play\nBut your words rubbed me the wrong way\nSo now, I'm

Give 'em a quick shot\nNow I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch\nYeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock\nIt's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'\nAnd tell them niggas this is Nick's spot\nThey don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked\nSaran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?\nI'm hot as fire wanna

for him, and Memphis represent for me\nTo the tenth degree, Tennekey, T-Dot to the country y'all\nOrange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal\nI ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map\nPeople get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap\nSo they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage\nMaybe they can bring they career back\nBut these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that\nCause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's\nCigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive\nAll my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check\nMy cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect\nThis can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks\nSingle mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back\nPurple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked\nRest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!\nYou think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny\nPull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nIt ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit\nYou cut us a check, then we go through some

Malik and Deja\nAnd that's some higher learning\nTrying to excel with the brake on\nI'll have you stuck in the same spot\nWith the tires burnin'\nAnd I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith\nIn any

years\nWhen some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact\nI bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with\nAnd in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do\nCause it's my

to freak with this\nI get a girl and pretend that I love the spending\nAnd all she gave was a decent kiss\nThinking she been spoiled\nBut golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days\nAnd come up with tin foil\nWe could dissect it see\nYou take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets\nAnd you picture that she just slept with me for nothing\nGave her nothing\nHer reputation's in jeopardy\nCause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me\nCollectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me\nInstead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting

get shy\nSee that was a segue, I believe the matter\nIs what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter\nWhere the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up\nDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up\nWhere girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in\nThe winter cars come out, the summer cars go in\nAnd some places is breezy, and some it start snowin'\nAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when\nBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city\nInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity\nCause mom stays up late, she seen them videos\nWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!\n\n[Drake talking]\nYeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man\nA lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one\nBut just wait, nah mean, take it slow\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nForget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach\nShe lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet\nSince I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite\nShe doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat\nShe throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat\nShe's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet\nThen she says \"I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat\nI mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat\nI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good\nThere's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat\"\nOff this I'm kinda taken back for a second\nI get her number she tells me to call her after this session\nAnd so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch\nUntil we end up sexin' and now my heart attached\nI'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern\nAnd realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!\n\n[Drake talking]\nYeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right\nUh, ya man, it's what it is\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nAnd now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench\nShe love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench\nBut, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown\nAnd I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench\nShe tellin everyone I'mma hold here down\nTell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town\nAnd stupid me I just listen to her\nInstead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round\nBut then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch\nThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed\nWhen we were together it seeming like way back when\nBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in\nSee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa\nInstead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana\nAnd it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime\nI guess, I lost another one to the wintertime\n\n[Bridge (Drake talking)]\nI miss you, most of all, my darling [Beat fades out]\n(give me a second to gather my thoughts)\n[Fades back in] Strolling in the park (Ho!)\nAnd watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)\n(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)\nStrolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing\n(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)\n(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)\n\n[Verse 4: Drake]\nI remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up\nNow Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup\nSo we can get back to them cognac nights\nWith dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right\nAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild\nThe winter came and blew his cold air through\nBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her\nBy the end of the week I would know that crew\nAnd we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene\nWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine\nAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'\nWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen\nBut this Summer is different it's a two man operation\nGranted the fact that we one man short\nGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation\nCause handlin' crack is a one man sport\nInstead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'\nI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'\nThe face, the breast, the bras, the toes\nI'm still solo and a long night draws to a close\nCause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside\nWe'll never talk again, scary and true\nThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified\nIt's what I'm lookin for to carry me through\nYet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it\nOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit\nAnd when they talk about they past and lovers\nAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others\nYet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride\nThere's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive\n\n[Voice]\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring",
