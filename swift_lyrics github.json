dropping you off\nAt 14 there's just so much you can't do\nAnd you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots\nBut don't make her drop you off around the block\nRemember that she's getting older too\nAnd don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school\n\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, just stay this little\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple\nNo one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred\nAnd even though you want to, just try to never grow up\n\nTake pictures in your mind of your childhood room\nMemorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home\nRemember the footsteps, remember the words said\nAnd all your little brother's favorite songs\nI just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone\n\nSo here I am in my new apartment\nIn a big city, they just dropped me off\nIt's so much colder than I thought it would be\nSo I tuck myself in and turn my night light on\n\nWish I'd never grown up\nI wish I'd never grown up\n\nOh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up\nI could still be little\nOh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up\nIt could still be simple\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, just stay this little\nOh darling, don't you ever grow up\nDon't you ever grow up, it could stay this

late nights\nLiving for the greater\nMove to Paris\nLiving on a prayer\n\nPeace, love\nOne thing leads into another\nDream big, aim small\nMan you gotta love her\nShe's got her hopes up\nGot 'em up to
